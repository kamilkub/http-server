# http-server
Personal HTTP server, created for learning of how protocol works and curiosity.


### My own implementation of http server, which currently supports GET, DELETE, PATCH and PUT requests.
### I took care of multithreading just so multiple clients can be served at the same time.
### Basically, this project was made out of curiosity and wanting to manipulate the packets sent through TCP protocol.
