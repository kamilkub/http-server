# http-server
Personal HTTP server, created for learning of how protocol works and curiosity.


My own implementation of http server, which currently supports GET, DELETE, PATCH and PUT requests. <br>
I took care of multithreading just so multiple clients can be served at the same time. <br>
Basically, this project was made out of curiosity and wanting to manipulate the packets sent through TCP protocol. <br>
Future implementations may include such things as creating a monster of a http server, or maybe own protocol.
